#FootyNet Description 

My app is for football fans, people who enjoy watching, playing and most importantly talking about football. I have chosen to go with the English Football leagues as a niche as I believe I know the most about English teams and feel most passionate about. 

My Social network brings people to this platform where people can find out information from reliable sorces, engage with them with the comments and likes functionality. They can share there football experience on the "timeline" with pictures or videos and also they can go to the forumn section where they can speak about football and even argue over football with the "Abuse zone". 

Its unique as people only speak about football and English football in particular as on Facebok and Twitter a lot of other posts get in the way such as makeup,gym and food posts. 

I am currently working on the design on moqups and trying out new things and see which works the best.
