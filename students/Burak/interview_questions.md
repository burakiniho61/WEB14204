##Interview Questions 

I interviewed 2 of my friend's friends for this project in order to find out what kind of social networks they use and how their experience was with [Football Fanatix](http://www.footballfanatix.com). They have a big interest in football and social media so I decided they would be the most suitable candidates to interview.  

####First interview was with Kabilan 

######Burak: How old are you? 

Kabilan: 20 years old 

######Burak: What is your gender? (wasn't really a neccesary question)
 
Kabilan: Male lol 

######Burak: Which social networks do you use?

Kabilan: Well just the usual, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat if it counts as a social media and Football fanatix of course

######Burak: How long do you spend on social networks a day? 

Kabilan: Well roughly I'd say about 2 hours probably but I guess it depends.
 
######Burak: Which Social network is your favourite? Why? 

Kabilan: I'd say Facebook as it has a variety of different functions, you can talk to friends, find out information as I like a lot of different pages, I can play games and yeah just chill on there and not get bored. 

######Burak: How many friends/followers do you have on your favourite social network?

Kabilan: I have 476 friends on Facebook

######Burak: Is there any features you would like to add to your favourite social network?

Kabilan: Well not for Facebook I think they've got everything perfect as it is

######Burak: How did you find out about the website football fanatix?  

Kabilan: One of my cousins is a member to it, so I thought Id join and see what it's like. 

######Burak: What was your first experience of the website like? 

Kabilan: Well not the best to be honest, there was no tutorial I had no idea how to use it. I just had to pick up on stuff myself. I spent about 10 minutes trying to familise myself with the website. It wasn't as easy as I thought it would be but yeah got the hang of it after a while. 

######Burak: Any problems with the website you experienced? 

Kabilan: It gets quite boring after a while as not a lot of content is published. It's not updated every second as Twitter is as obviously more people use Twitter. Only 15-20 posts are done every day which makes it quite boring.

Amalan: 24 years old 

######Burak: What is your gender? 
 
Amalan: Male

######Burak: Which social networks do you use?

Amalan: Well I tend to just use Twitter and Football Fanatix. I like to publish content on football fanatix hence why I use that a lot. I found out news about football on Twitter and then publish it on Football Fanatix. 

######Burak: How long do you spend on social networks a day? 

Amalan: I spend about 1 hour but most of that would be on Football Fanatix
 
######Burak: Which Social network is your favourite? Why? 

Amalan: I'd say Football Fanatix as I found out a lot of information about football, and football is what I enjoy. I find out information that I dont even find on Twitter straight away which makes the site interesting.

Amalan: I have 92 friends on Football Fanatix.

######Burak: Is there any features you would like to add to your favourite social network?

Amalan: Erm, probably a chat system would be quite good, it will be interesting to chat to friends about football. 

######Burak: How did you find out about the website football fanatix?  

Amalan: I found out about it on Twitter, I was looking for a good Football Social network that I can join and just talk about football as other content gets in the way on Twitter, people talking about going to the gym and going on holiday. I just want to find out about football. 

######Burak: What was your first experience of the website like? 

Amalan: It could have been better as there was no tutorial but I got my way around things quite quickly so I kinda knew what I was doing. I had to add random people because I didnt really have any friends using this website.

######Amalan: Any problems with the website you experienced? 

Kabilan: I dont think there is a any problems with it, maybe if there was a chat system that I can speak to some people on there privately howevever it is an social network which is only for football so we can just post on eachothers walls.
