I did some usability testing in order to find out if my social network is easy for people to use, understand and notice. 

My first question was what do you think this social network is about? I found out that the majority of the people knew exactly what it was about and said it was about football, this may be because of the football symbol or maybe the football post however I knew this was a good message, people knew the exact topic.

My second question was where would you click to go on to Chelsea's website, as I found out from usertesting I did with Sefa he wasn't able to identify the link to the clubs website straight way therefore I thought to test thing on UsabilityHub and found out that again this wasn't a good result for me. People clicked on the wrong place(which may have been because they wanted to skip straight away) but again I found out that the link on the league table wasn't as clear to some people so I thought I should take this feature off from my website.

My next click next was to find out where users would click to be able to find out more abotu the news on Falcao signing for Manutd, this was a successful test and found out that majority off the users were able to click on more which was a link to find out more. This made me decide to leave the more button feature on my website.

I then asked a 5 second test and wanted to find out if people noticed the red card and if so what did they think it was for? I found out that most of the users were able to relate it to football and thought it would be a negative thing for a user. They thought it was to block someone and were able to identify that without any problems.

I also did a preference test on the news page to find out if people prefered the visual side or the text side. One had more images and the other had more text. From the results I found out that people prefered the visual side with more pictures therefore I considered this and made sure I used more images on the news page.
