#Interviewing Humans
I think the 'Interview Humans' article is very interesting as it has the perfect interview style. I have learnt some new things that I will consider in future when interview people and some things I already did. 

Firstly when I interview someone I always try to stick to the topic however when the person I'm interviewing has something out of topic he wants to talk about that his passionate about, I will let the person speak about it in order to make the person feel comfortable and not in pressure and once he/she finishes speaking about it I will bring the conversation back to the topic. As the article states "The more comfortable a participant feels, the more and better information you will get." So I think having the client more relaxed is better for me in terms of quality of information. 

I also always plan out my questions before hand in order to avoid any awkward moments where no one knows what to say. I plan my questions according to my goal of what to get out the interview and make sure I stick to my questions when interview unless the client has already answered the question. I always avoid speaking about myself in the n interview as that is quality information time for the client wasted. I focus on gaining the most out of the client. 

There has been times when interviewing where the conversation went to another topic and it went really well. We had a laugh about something else but carried on speaking about the main topic passionately. We were comfortable with each other and the client didnt feel like they were in pressure. They actually wanted to help me get to my goal which was to get information and views of his behalf. 

I think the most challenge about interviewing people is the first 5 minutes where you see each other for the first time if your interviewing someone anoynmous. You have to feel comfortable with each other and make sure the person your interviewing feels comfortable and not in pressure. I always aim to ask open questions to get the conversation going on and if I was to ask a closed question i'd ask them to expand on that by asking why. 

With the data I collect during articles I normally note them down as much as I can after I've listened to them carefully however if there are long answers im expecting I always take a recorder after agreeing with the person getting interviewed as this makes it more accurate as I can miss out on things when writing them down. When recorded I can listed to it over and over again at home and then analyse the results from the interview.
