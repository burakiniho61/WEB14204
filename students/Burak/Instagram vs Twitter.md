**Instagram** Hi blog

**Twitter**: Oh you can speak? Thought you were just pictures 

**Instagram**: Oh at least I haven't got a limit of 140 characters. Lol 

**Twitter** You still speaking? And why do you even share content to me. Its a trap, people have to click on the link which then sends people to you. 

**Instagram** Muhahahaha, Clever arent I 

**Twitter** Your so annoying, like your 15 second videos 

**Instagram** You can talk, you only have 6 second videos and they're not even made by you. Theyre made by Vine. 

**Twitter** Your taking it too far, but did you know more people use Twitter than Instagram hahaha 

**Instagram** Do you want me to get my bro Facebook into this? 

**Twitter** Im done. think I'm running out of characters bye. 

**Instagram** Lol
