###The time is ripe for a new wave of niche social networks

I read about this article and thought it was very interesting. Was linked to my social network as my social network is also an network aimed at a niche market. The author says that niche social networks will take over giving the example of a fisherman will be feel better using a fisherman social network than Facebook like the other billions of people in the world. 

FootyNet is targeted at English football and even lower divisions such as League 1 and League 2. This is a niche as there isn't a social network out there which is aimed at lower divisions. Lower league fans feel lefted out at times and would happily fit my social network and feellike they are a part of a community. 

The author says that niche social networks will take over and people will start using them as it has more content about there subject. Why wouldn't a fisherman who spends $1500 on equipment not spend an extra $50 dolors for an app aimed at him. The author is right... well I guess what a time to bring out FootyNet. 

Lower League fans come to me....
