###Are UI walkthroughs evil?


Wow interesting views on walkthroughs. I understand that you need to give people space when they visit an app for the first time but arent you also meant to make them feel comfortable and welcome? Teach them and make them familiar with whats going on in the app at first in my opinion to make them feel like they are part of something. You always have the option to skip anyway so it can't be an issue surely. 

I was planning to use a walthrough in my product and with my final product finished I did. I used a walkthrough to help people feel comfortable and let people know the app inside out so when they look for something they dont spend 10 minutes looking for it or do a Google search on: 'Where is the settings page on FootyNet'. If you dont want a tutorial just skip it, im not forcing you to do it. 

I think walkthroughs are useful for most apps if your on there for the first time and want the app to be a app you regularly use. I want to know the app inside out. To be honest with some apps its unneccesary such as Instagram, people know what the app is for without even using it because it's big but a walkthrough wont kill anyone, just skip like I said before. 

An Innovative way to guide new users through my product could be to make them do tasks while giving them a walkthrough. I could have a task like share your first FootyPost and teach them that once shared it will appear on the feed so making them multitask, share and also learn at the same time.
