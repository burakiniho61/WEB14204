##What do you want to get out of this unit/project?###List at least 3 goals.
For the Designing the UX project we are asked to create or re-design a Social Network. There are thousands of Social networks out there all for different kinds of people such as different genders,ages, hobbies and etc. Everyone has a common social network they use which is [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) but there are some social networks for certain people such as [dating for over 60 year olds](http://www.singlesover60.co.uk).    
I have set myself 3 goals to achieve before the end off this project. Firstly I like to design however I am not at the highest level of designing (yet). I want to develop my skills on photoshop and then implement my design onto the website itself. I can improve my photoshop skills by watching videos on [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/Photoshop-tutorials/279-0.html?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search-Dsg-Photoshop&utm_content=FyqpI3Wn&utm_term=photoshop%20tutorials&gclid=CLzVxd7elMMCFcSWtAodojQALw), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) and [photoshop essentials](http://www.photoshopessentials.com)
Secondly to research. I think research is an important process to getting to a perfect product. User interface is important and without research you wont know what your customer want. For this project I plan to do research in order to get the final product "outstanding" that will appeal to the people using the social network. 
My final goal is to unlock my potential and show what I can actually produce and am capable of. I am not confident in translating my ideas into code. I am creative however not able to put this onto a website due to my coding skills. I want to higher my coding skills and make sure in this unit that I put my thoughts onto paper.

###Why are these goals important to you?As a student, as a person, and/or as a creative professional.Where do you currently stand?•	What are your strengths and your weaknesses? •	How do you intend you develop them further? •	Who do you admire? What can you learn from them?How do you intend to achieve your goals?•	What small steps could you take towards making it happen?•	How do you learn best? What hinders your learning?•	What are you proud of in your learning and what do you wish you could do better?Could you summarise your intentions in one word?Things to considerWhy should I do this?Reflection is what happens when you are in front of a mirror. You can see yourself, think about your appearance, and change it based on the information that the mirror offers you.Imagine a world without mirrors (and without cameras to take selfies). How would your self-perception change in such a world? Would you feel bigger, or smaller, more beautiful, or uglier?Likewise, imagine a student who doesn't reflect on her learning.SMART goalsSome people argue that effective goals are SMART1	Specific Details, details, details. What do you really want to learn?2	Measurable How can you measure the results of your learning? Where do you currently stand, and how much do you want to change?3	Attainable Challenge yourself, but not so much that you become overwhelmed. How can you achieve your goals?4	Realistic Can you do it? How much effort do you need?5	Timely What can I do today? What can I do every day? What can I do 12 weeks from now? What's your deadline?A SMART learning goal is structured so that anyone who reads your goal statement will understand what you want to learn. Here are two examples of SMART goals:•	I want to build a custom WordPress theme for my uncle's business by December 9I want to run the local charity 10k race on June 15
