### Transitional Interfaces

What a start to an article, pixel f*cking love that aha. The time line of the ball moving from point 1 to 25 very interesting. Depending on where you set the middle point in the timeline, changes the speed of the ball unless you set it right at the middle where the ball travels same speed throughout. I can do maths Yay! And also cushioning/easing. Although it wasn't an animation tutorial I picked up quite a lot from just that example. 

Can I relate this article to my social network? Yes and no? No because I havent got the crazy animations like the article does but yes with the drilling down. For instance my welcome page, I have all log in buttons on the page, log in with Facebook, log in with Twitter and log in. Maybe I can drill that down and have a log in button where it will take you to another page which will give you log in options.
