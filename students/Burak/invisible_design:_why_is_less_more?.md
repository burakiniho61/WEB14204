### INVISIBLE DESIGN: WHY IS LESS MORE?

Wow that tube image, cool image always wanted to know what the inside of the underground looked like. Thanks article 

Lucky guy who visited Nepal, would have loved to see a Rhino running at me NOT. Must have been tense...

Interactive invisibility woah, I didnt even realise this, I guess im really a boy who has been using 'proper' technology since 2006 and yeah its true the change of features, its gone from everyone using paint where you have to physically move the mouse to draw something to apps now a days where you can actually draw things with your hand on the mobile screen. Is it good or bad? Neither Its just easier for people to do, the technology has changed our lives and made them easier. People are lazier, people wont go and find a dictionary they will just use Google translate which translates 'invisibly'. You don't notice it but the application does it for you. Magic

Peekaboo omg I loved that game, sad times Im getting old and not playing it anymore, but I love the way the author related that game to this, its true you don't have too see things to know its there. Applications work like that you dont have to see the swipe to find your match on tinder all the time because you know it will work regardless. You rely on it and know that its just hiding behind the screen.
