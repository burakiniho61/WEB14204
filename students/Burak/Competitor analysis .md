##Competitor Analysis 


####Competitors

My first direct competitor is 'Football Fanatix' who are a social network who talk about football. They talk about all football league such as the Spanish, English, French, German, Italian etc. This is different from the social network I want to create as my network is targetted to only English Leagues. This will mean I will have more content for English teams where as 'Football Fanatix' have content about everything so English football isn't their priority. 

My second competitor is 'Fubles' which is a social network where they bring people together who look for people to play football with. The website is quite basic and dont have a lot of content about football news or anything. It is just a social media to bring people together, meet up and play football with them. 

Sports Lobster, the highest rated and strongest competitor. They are a direct competitor as their social network is very similar to mine. All you do is talk about football and share about football. You can join fanzones which will mean the only content you will see at your homepage will be able the football clubs you have selected. There are articles shared on there by professionals and also regular posts by people who enjoy the sport football. You can also follow people as a way of being friends with them.  

####Audience(s)

I believe the audience for Football Fanatix is people who enjoy football and like to post about it. Passionate fans that like to chat about football on there free time. The website's design is quite poor therefore the people using the social network isn't a high number. They have 150 members using the social network at the moment. 

Fubles have a different audience, although its still about football, it doesn't have to be about liking football. As Fubles is a platform that allows you to meet up with friends and play football with them, you dont have to neccessarily like football and like to talk about football. You can just do it as a hobby and just want to play the sport for fun purposes. You dont have to speak about football but just play it. 

Sports Lobster has a similar audience compared with Football Fanatix. Their audience is people who like to talk about football however this isn't just ordinary people, they also have professionals who share articles and talk about football also therefore they have a bit of both amateurs and proffesionals talking and sharing football.

####Relationship(s)

The kind of relationships users can establish in Football fanatix is just friends where they can talk about football with. They also have a chat system where you can speak about football privately with friends. The platform is open and as there are only 150 members everyone can see eachother's posts however to private message them you will have to add them. 

Fubles is the strongest out of the 3 to bring people together. As you use the platform to meet up to play football, you will have to see them in person. People will have to trust each other in this platform to meet up by using the reviews section how many points they have. If they have a lot of points then people will be more likely to meet up with each other. 

Sports Lobster have a follow system where you can follow your favourite team and see posts about them but also follow specific people if you just want to see posts by them. It's quite similar to Twitter, as you follow to see posts and also have a way of unfollowing if you are not happy with the users posts. 



####Reciprocity

On Football fanatix you can see all members posts as its a small platform with 150 users however if you want to private message any of the members, you will have to add them as a friend and if they accept, then you can message them privately. Its one big community where everyone talks about football. 

On fubles there is a follow system where you can follow a user and then are able to see any activities by that user. For example when they organise a football match you will be notivied. Also users you follow will be able to automatically sign you up to any matches they create however you can change this in settings. 

On Sports Lobster there is also a follow system where can follow users and see what they post. Another thing you can do on Sports Lobster is join fanzones for example joining Manutd Fanzone will mean you will see all posts about Manutd. This will be articles and also be posts by people. If they post anything about manutd then you will be able to see this. 


####Homophily

As all of the 3 social networks are about football, its just a hobby so even if you are male or female, as it's a community you can form ties and be friends. Football brings people together as people only talk about football in these social networks. In fubles they meet up and play football however for the other 2 networks there is a common interest of just talking about football and being competitive if you support different teams. Age again isn't a issue for Football Fanatix and SportsLobster, it kind of relys on how much you know about football howeve for fubles it may be different. Users may be only looking for people who are aged a specific age to allow the football match that you will play be competitive.  


####Content(s)

The kind of Content users are producing for Football Fanatix and Sports lobster is just about football in general. Any football news taking place, football matches fixtures and results and informing each other. Football is the common interest any people just talk about football, when they private message each other they may talk about other things however in the platform it self they talk about football.

With Fubles, its a bit different as people talk about meeting up. They create events by selecting football pitches nearby and inviting friends to play with them. If you are already friends with the user then you can automatically invite them when creating the event unless they have different settings. 

The kind of comments people post for football Fanatix and sports lobster are just football related. People can be annoyed if someone is posting about a team beating another where users can respond by saying ahh their not that great and use abusive language. As Football fanatix is a social network where a lot of amateur people use it this may appear however for sports lobsters its more proffessional so people are less likely to use abusive language. 

With fubles there is a forum section where people can post any matches that are available and people can comment if they are free. The things people will tend to discuss is if they are free to play football or not. 

Youtube is a social network where people talk about videos. Peoples comments change depending on the video they watch. They can get amused by cat videos. I believe visual is very important on a social network, people respond differently to things they see hence why comments can be moronic. 

####Currency

The type of things people exchange on football fanatix and Sports lobster is information. People keep each other informed and updated on what is going on. Information is more vital on Sports lobster as there are proffessionals who post updates and also as there are fanzones where you follow your favourite football clubs profile, people expect more information to keep updated. With football fanatix it more about people posting football experiences and post about anything random. This can be disscusion about their favorite team or any pictures they want to post up. They have a like function on both websites so people can interact with others posts. With fubles this is different as unless you post a forum there isnt a way to get likes however you can get more points from when you play football the  more goals you score etc you can be a higher rated player. 

####Content definition

With Football Fanatix you are asked to sign up by creating a profile where you have to fill football information as well as basic information. For example you have to fill in information about your favourite football moment and this gets people involed with the website. They feel like they are getting into the social network straight away.

Football fanatix has a long process of signing up as you have to answer a lot of questions such as your favourite sports team favourite football moment and your basic account details. People can get bored of entering details so they can leave the website which I would like to avoid with my social network. Having facebook and twitter a way of signing up is the best option.


####Blank slate

When registering I will use Facebook and Twitter as I believe this will quicker the process and save time for users. After they sign up they are able to find friends via their facebook friends so this means they can get content straight away.
