##The internets own boy

What a genius inventing TheInfo, so there was a 12 year old who built an early version of Wikipedia, I was playing Pokemon cards when I was 12. [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com) interesting guy...

####How do you feel about freedom of information? 
Creative Commons, good way to make you 'own' your work. I think people should calm down with the permission they give and the protectiveness of their work. I understand you spent money and time doing it but be more reliant to users. I feel like information should be shared to everyone except security info like [Pacer](https://www.pacer.gov). Wrong move Aaron. I wouldn't want to go near that website and I wouldn't advise you to. Why do people even want to access this? I know its important info for some people but If you know your going to get in trouble for it why push it? I think content in general should be free but security info like that cant be free because its too 'valuable'.   
####What do you think constitutes digital theft? 
There are too many tools and websites out there which pushes people to digital theft. Im talking about music for basics, there are so many tools out there for youtube converter so why would people bother going to itunes and buying the track. My 'friends' do it so why shouldn't I do it some people think well they have a point because you dont even get caught for it. 20 Years ago NO WAY would you just go to a music shop and just get the cassette for free and walk out like nothings happened. Thats what people are doing online without realising their actually stealing. 
####How do you feel about Net Neutrality?

From what I have found about Net Neutrality I think its a bit of a different one. To treat all data on the equally? How can you possibly do that. Some data is more valuable than others and some websites are more important than other websites for some people. Facebook has 1.3 billion users, you cant compare that with a niche social network can you? Surely not? 
#### If you had magical powers, would you use them for good or to make you mountains of cash?
Well that's an interesting question and I'd say make montains of cash? You know why? Because I can use that mountains of cash for something good? Weren't expecting that were you? Just donate to a lot of charities and obviously leave some for me and family but majority would be spent of helping the poor and sick. So I'm doing both by going by one path, make mountains of cash to use it for good :)
