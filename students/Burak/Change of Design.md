A lot of changes have been made through time on my designs. Firstly with the homepage, i found out that people thought the league logos looked like buttons so I made them smaller . I also picked up from the feedback that maybe to give a tease to the users of whats inside the website from the homepage so I added a Go to FootyNet Forum section and Go to FootyNet News section.

Secondly on the news page of the website I found out that people thought the navigation on the top of the page wasn't easy to see and that grey and white didn't work well on each other. i also found out that people would like an option to filter news by there club, so I added that in.Â I also changed the layout of the page as Ali(one of my user testers) said that It looked quite messy at the moment.

The profile page layout didn't change as much however the red card system was added on the profile page. From what I found out from the userTesting, people were not able to find the red card block system as it was on the settings page.

The forums layout changed after looking at different forums and there layout/design. As I was using black and grey a lot throughout my website, I thought I should have the same colours on this page.

Finally the Settings Page, the Yellow card and Red card feature was added to the profile page and replaced with Language feature. As I found out from the feedback that Callum thought being able to change the language might be a good feature to have.
