#Action Plan

From the feedback I recieved from my presentation, there are a few things I need to consider before designing my app. 

Firstly I will do more research about what users want from my app. What specific feautures they would like my app to do and which information they want from my app. The way I will do this is by doing more interviews asking people who are interested in football, what they want from a football app, which kind of information they want to find out. 

Another thing I need to work on in my app is to get features I want people to use the most, to stand out so people interact with them the most. The way I will do this is by doing another design where the features are standing out to get people to interact with it. 

I need to think of a way to get professionals encouraged to post on my social network. For example a lot of football reporters and managers use twitter and I need to think of a way to get people to do the same with my social network. I can consider paid posting at the start in order to get the social network well known, after its well known people will automatically start to use it.

One of the points I picked up from the presentation is getting articles intergrated with the app so people dont have to be directed to another website to find out about the news. I think this is something I will take into account and go with this idea as people will visit my website for articles instead of being directed to other websites. I will also consider an abuse zone where people can argue and have a go at each other without disturbing other peoples conversations. This will mean people who just want to visit the app to argue with eachother about football have the oppurtunity to.
